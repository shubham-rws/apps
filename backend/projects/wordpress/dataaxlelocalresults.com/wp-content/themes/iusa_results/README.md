# Infogroup WordPress Theme by AW

This is the base WordPress theme for Infogroup websites. It is based on the [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites) frontend framework. There is a SASS and JS compiler built in for use on your local machine. Read the instructions below

## Installation

To use this theme, your computer needs:

- [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

- [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) - `npm install gulp --save-dev`

- [Gulp Sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) - `npm install gulp-sourcemaps --save-dev`

- [Gulp Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) - `npm install gulp-sass --save-dev`

- [Gulp Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) - `npm install --save-dev gulp-autoprefixer`

- [Gulp Concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat) - `npm install gulp-concat --save-dev`

- [Gulp Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify) - `npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev`

- [Gulp Load Plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-load-plugins) - `npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins`

### Using the CLI

Navigate via the command line to the directory that the theme is contianed in

**`npm run build`** This command will compile the SASS and JS after any changes are made and the files have been saved.

**`npm run watch`** This command will automtically compile the SASS and JS after any changes are made and the file is saved, and the `npm run build` is not necessary if "watch" is on.

### Files to edit

**SCSS** - The files you should edit are in the `/scss/partials` directory, or the `/scss/_settings.scss` file. Any new partials added will need to be imported at the top of `/scss/app.scss` or they will not be compiled. The compiled and minified file is located at `/css/app.css` - **Do Not Edit This File**

**JS** - The files you should edit are in the `/js/infogroup` directory. Files located in the other `/js/*` directories are vendor files that we do not edit. Any new additions must be in the `/js` directory, and can use sub-directories. The combined and minified file is located at `/js-dist/distribution.js` - **Do Not Edit This File**

**Gulp** - The only gulp file is located in the root of the theme and called `gulpfile.js`. This will only be edited to add additional JS files to the combine/uglify script. These are added by setting their path in the `var jsPaths` array variable. Any new additions must be in the `/js` directory, and can use sub-directories.

### Sourcetree/Git Repo

After any files are edited, added, deleted, or modified in any way will all need to be committed and pushed into the git repo for the particular theme. This is the main theme's git repo clone URL: `https://infogroup.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/SMB-CMS/_git/InfogroupWPTheme`, but this is not the repo you will commit/push to when working on individual sites. Obtian those from VSTS > SMB-CMS > Code > Select Git Repo > Click "Clone" on right side to obtain the unique clone URL.
