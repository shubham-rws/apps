  Unfortunately WordPress will require a style.css file
  located in the theme's root folder for stuff to work.

  However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass.

  Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features
  such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also
  the easiest way to customize Foundation.

  All Sass files are located in the /scss folder in the root of the theme.
  Please note that none of your scss files will be compiled to /css/app.css before you run
  'foundation watch' or 'foundation build'.

  Please read the README.md file before getting started. More info on how
  to use Sass with Foundation can be found here:
  http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html
